# Ionic
Project from college. A shopping app.
In the project, on the home page, i use the List component, create a list, simulate five items in the list. When the user clicks on an item in the list, the application will display a message indicating which item was chosen. For the message,I use the Toast component.
I create a menu that navigates to all pages in the application.
Create a new page, add a button to the page (Button). The text of the button is "Enter your details". When the user clicks the button, the application should show an alert screen. Was used the Alert component to do this. The alert window have two fields for data input, which will be email and telephone, and the “Cancel” and “Send” buttons. When clicking the send button, the application show the user's email and telephone number on the application page.
When the user clicks the button, the application show an alert screen.The Alert component was used to do this. The alert window have two fields for data input, which will be email and telephone, and the “Cancel” and “Send” buttons.
Create two more new pages, on the first i use the Inputs component, include fields for username and password. Include a button with the text "Sign in". The user must enter a name and password and when clicking the button the application must validate the login and password, if validation passes, the application must transition to the second page and must welcome the user (simulate a valid username and password).
If the password or login is not valid,i use an alert to notify the user.
To finish,a new page was create and the Badge component was used,i create two badges with texts and figures.
